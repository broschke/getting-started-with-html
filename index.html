  Major pieces of the web: <br>
<br>
Browsers - a program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web<br>
The internet - the world's largest computer network<br>
HTTP - protocol to connect browser to server<br>
Servers - computers the host the files that make up the internet<br>
<br>
HTML Markup<br>
Consists of Tags and Content. Tags tell the computer to how display the contents.
Together this is called an Element. 
Format is <name> contents </name> or <opening tag> contents <closing tags>
<br>
<br>
Examples of tags
the b tag <b> makes content bold </b><br>
the em tag <em> makes content italicised </em>
<br>
the anchor tag, a,  make links in a webpage
<a href="www.udacity.com"> udacity</a>
where href is an attribute and www.udacity.com is the value
<br>
the image tag format is as follows:<br>
"<"img src="url" alt="text">"<br>
where <b>url</b> is where the image is downloaded from and the <b>alt</b> or alternate is the text that is displayed when the image fails to load<br>
image tags have no closing tag because it has no content. Also called <b>void tag</b>
<br>
<br>
Whitespace tags<br>
the br tag creates a line break<br> This moves text after the tag to a new line.
the p tag renders content in one paragraph. since it has content, it requires a closing tag
br tag is a void tag<br>
HTML code does not need to follow the action of the whitespace tags<br>
Inline vs Block - the br tag is an inline element, simply text.<br>
the p tag is a block element, an invisible block is created around the content of a p tag<br>

<p>span and div elements - simply contain their content but have the ability to edit how the content is laid out with CSS<br>
span is inline while div is block. both require closing tags</p>
